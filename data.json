That curiosity is why after graduating from business school I became a small scale farmer, rancher, and budding Permaculture practitioner.\r\n\r\nAfter a deep focus on understanding and stewarding landscapes, I came to realize that humans know how to cultivate abundant and resilient ecosystems. Despite our desperate need for that to happen, our ever expanding human built environment and our runaway cultural compulsion towards separation from nature and each other gets in our way.\r\n\r\nI am now exploring the ecology of social and cultural systems and how we can discover ways that Homo sapiens can adapt towards better relationships with Earth. Now I ask: How can we as a species rediscover our landscapes as home?\r\n\r\nCurrently I am part of a community called Earth Regenerators that is cultivating a learning and support ecosystem to explore questions like that. I founded a group within that community called Bioregional Catalysts that is searching for real world examples of communities coming together for landscape scale regeneration to distribute and facilitate replication of what we learn across the planet. We also support individuals and small groups who aspire to convene their communities to see their landscapes as a whole in order to enable local regeneration.\r\n\r\nI am a facilitator, a cultural scaffold builder, a content creator, an aspiring storyteller, and I am in service to the planetary scale community commons.",

The good news is that it really is possible to regenerate the Earth at the scales needed. In order to do so, we must consciously and intentionally evolve humanity into a\u00a0<em>planetary species</em>\u00a0and learn to cooperate at unprecedented levels. We must organize ourselves around holistic, integrated landscapes known as bioregions, and connect those bioregions into a planetary network of learning exchanges.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Design School are working together on the ground in bioregions while simultaneously building a planetary network and community engaging in this kind of bioregional work. We are learning how to cooperate at the levels needed by practicing and working within Prosocial groups. This enables focused actions to arise with clear design and intent so that we can effectively regenerate at the bioregional scale and create interactions and supports between and across bioregions. All of this being done in service to the regeneration of the entire Planet.",

I think lots of community healing and placemaking can happen centered around creation and art, and I\u2019m excited to see how I can share the benefits of tapping into one\u2019s creative potential. I love to create murals, fiber arts, mosaics, natural building, jewelry making, etc. I love how creativity is a wonderful alternative to consumerism, and I think tapping into creative energy and art in different ways allows for beneficial trades and mutual aid to take place!\r\n\r\nI have some experience with permaculture gardening, and am continuing to grow in this skill. Tending the earth has opened me up to so much purpose and alignment with what feels like embodying my authentic self. I love community togetherness that occurs when tending the earth and therefore, tending to each other. Working with medicinal plants and herbs has been a wonderful practice for me to communicate and connect with our mother Gaia through these different plant spirits and energies.

Inspired by my grandpa Jerry who ran an integrated farm on<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>South Whidbey island. He was visited by Bill Mollison in the early 70's. After taking many short workshops on animals, grafting, gardening etc. my wife took a PDC with the Bullock brothers which I visited often. We held a PDC in 2009 here at Inspiration Farm featuring Robin Francis and Doug Bullock as instructors among others.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Inspiration Farm is an 13 acre homestead styled farm since 1994. Integrating Biodynamic and Permaculture practices in relation to annual & perennial food systems, animal husbandry, appropriate technology, land/water nutrient management. Currently we have 1.5 acres in annual production and 2 acres of fruit, nut and other perennials. We have chickens, milk cow, goats and raise turkeys and pigs most years. Our vision at Inspiration Farm is to co-create an environment to experiment and learn methods of creative and regenerative, resilient thriving.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Biodynamic farming is a type of organic farming that incorporates an understanding of natural dynamic forces not yet fully understood by science. By working creatively with these subtle energies, we are able to significantly enhance the health of our farm affecting the quality of the soil, nutrition and flavor of the food grown.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Throughout the year we have a variety of Events, Tours and Workshops. This year we are hosting several workshops on permaculture and sustainable practices. Contact us if you would like to be notified on workshops that we will be hosting or would like to bring a group for a experiential farm tour.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Are you interested in taking a Permaculture Design Certificate Course? We want to hear from you.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>619 E Laurel rd.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bellingham Wa 98226</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">360-319--2029</p>",

Got involved in organizing Cascadia bioregional congresses after attending the first one in 1986 at Evergreen State College. Was lead organizer for the Bioregional Congress of Pacific Cascadia at Breitenbush in 1988, & the Mish Bioregional Gathering at Deception Pass in 1990. Been involved in various indy media projects since working at RAIN, including the Portland Alliance, Seattle Community Catalyst, the Seattle Independent Media Center, Eat the State!, & Catalytic Community. Was grateful to see the Cascadian bioregional resurgence in the 21st century, & connected with Brandon Letsinger several years ago to see how I could be of service. Helped launch Cascadia Spoke.",
