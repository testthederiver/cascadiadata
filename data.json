I fell in love with the land and returned in the early 90's to study for some months when the Process Work group I had been studying with moved from Europe to Portland. My contact with Oregon resumed after immigrating to Southern California in 2001. While participating in Edge Prize I met Cascadia people online and learned about many amazing activities and projects. As a southern outpost of Salmon Nation, I feel an affinity with my northern neighbours. I engage in bioregional work through online networking as well as on-ground and wish to support Regenerate Cascadia however I might be of practical service.",

That curiosity is why after graduating from business school I became a small scale farmer, rancher, and budding Permaculture practitioner.\r\n\r\nAfter a deep focus on understanding and stewarding landscapes, I came to realize that humans know how to cultivate abundant and resilient ecosystems. Despite our desperate need for that to happen, our ever expanding human built environment and our runaway cultural compulsion towards separation from nature and each other gets in our way.\r\n\r\nI am now exploring the ecology of social and cultural systems and how we can discover ways that Homo sapiens can adapt towards better relationships with Earth. Now I ask: How can we as a species rediscover our landscapes as home?\r\n\r\nCurrently I am part of a community called Earth Regenerators that is cultivating a learning and support ecosystem to explore questions like that. I founded a group within that community called Bioregional Catalysts that is searching for real world examples of communities coming together for landscape scale regeneration to distribute and facilitate replication of what we learn across the planet. We also support individuals and small groups who aspire to convene their communities to see their landscapes as a whole in order to enable local regeneration.\r\n\r\nI am a facilitator, a cultural scaffold builder, a content creator, an aspiring storyteller, and I am in service to the planetary scale community commons.",

Inspired by my grandpa Jerry who ran an integrated farm on<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>South Whidbey island. He was visited by Bill Mollison in the early 70's. After taking many short workshops on animals, grafting, gardening etc. my wife took a PDC with the Bullock brothers which I visited often. We held a PDC in 2009 here at Inspiration Farm featuring Robin Francis and Doug Bullock as instructors among others.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Inspiration Farm is an 13 acre homestead styled farm since 1994. Integrating Biodynamic and Permaculture practices in relation to annual & perennial food systems, animal husbandry, appropriate technology, land/water nutrient management. Currently we have 1.5 acres in annual production and 2 acres of fruit, nut and other perennials. We have chickens, milk cow, goats and raise turkeys and pigs most years. Our vision at Inspiration Farm is to co-create an environment to experiment and learn methods of creative and regenerative, resilient thriving.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Biodynamic farming is a type of organic farming that incorporates an understanding of natural dynamic forces not yet fully understood by science. By working creatively with these subtle energies, we are able to significantly enhance the health of our farm affecting the quality of the soil, nutrition and flavor of the food grown.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Throughout the year we have a variety of Events, Tours and Workshops. This year we are hosting several workshops on permaculture and sustainable practices. Contact us if you would like to be notified on workshops that we will be hosting or would like to bring a group for a experiential farm tour.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Are you interested in taking a Permaculture Design Certificate Course?

Our mission is to conserve and sequester carbon through collaborative natural climate solutions in Northwest Washington. We promote adopting collaborative natural climate solutions (NCS) that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, regenerate ecosystems, sequester carbon, and revitalize rural communities. As a positive response to climate change, we endeavor to grow and protect carbon reserves by systematically reducing carbon emissions attributable to agriculture and forestry. We selected these sectors because farms and forests are essential to our local economy and, overall, these land uses are responsible for one-quarter of GHG emissions. Rather than waiting for a top-down policy response, we are developing an adaptive, community-based, and incentive-driven approach to stimulate regenerative NCS. These down-to-earth actions harness life-giving physical and biochemical processes such as photosynthesis and soil microbial activity that cause ecosystems to thrive and grow carbon reserves. Ecological Forestry Agroforestry Biochar Regenerative Agriculture Blue Carbon KCT's role is to convene and facilitate stakeholder groups with complementary interests. We intend to organize at a meaningful scale the types of regenerative NCS projects that enable participants to earn a living and landscapes to thrive. We also want to help fund NCS projects by tapping traditional and regenerative financing. Our strategy involves propagating know-how, advancing a proper legal framework, and developing economic incentives for people interested in applying NCS to create a better future for themselves and their children. Considering threats related to climate change and the benefits of early action, KCT has identified the following nature-based solutions as appropriate for our service territory: We will work with diverse stakeholders to encourage land stewardship methods that stockpile carbon and promote vital ecosystem services. We focus on building resilience to help communities prepare for and respond to climate disruption. Our nonprofit aims to make forests and fields within our NW Washington service territory a living laboratory for regeneration.",

I support my local farmers, and I grow what we can in our small garden, enthusiastic about learning how to work with nature to optimize food availability and nutrition.  My healthcare is supported through homeopathy, and I have gained a energetic perspective of the world through long discussions with my doctor over the years.

In 1976 I was a lead organizer of a bioregional gathering intended to establish a regional federation of cooperatives. I'm the fc0-ounder and program director of the Dharmalaya Center in Eugene, the Director of the PROUT Institute (proutinstitute.org), and the primary instructor for Transformation Education (https://transformation-education.teachable.com/). A primary hat I wear is that of an ordained meditation teacher in the yogic tradition. I've authored four books on new paradigm political theory, including \"Transformation to a New Era.\" I lectured extensively internationally as well as giving many webinars. In 1993 I was invited  by the Governor of the Russian Far East state of Khabarovsk to draft a development plan based on the post-capitalist social philosophy, PROUT. I was the lead organizer for three regional permaculture gatherings in the early 2000s. Dharmalaya, where I live is a model of sustinable living. Dharmalaya has held many trainings, including a summer program called \"Community Transformations\" that gave participants an integrated vision of regenerative communities. Dharmalaya is in the heart of the \"River Road permaculture zone\" in Eugene and has involved in many permaculture and regenerative community initiatives and gatherings.",
