I fell in love with the land and returned in the early 90's to study for some months when the Process Work group I had been studying with moved from Europe to Portland. My contact with Oregon resumed after immigrating to Southern California in 2001. While participating in Edge Prize I met Cascadia people online and learned about many amazing activities and projects. As a southern outpost of Salmon Nation, I feel an affinity with my northern neighbours. I engage in bioregional work through online networking as well as on-ground and wish to support Regenerate Cascadia however I might be of practical service.",
