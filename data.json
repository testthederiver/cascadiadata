      "statement": "Cascadia was the first US bioregion I lived in for two and a half years during the mid-70's and it was already more environmentally aware than other places I'd lived. I fell in love with the land and returned in the early 90's to study for some months when the Process Work group I had been studying with moved from Europe to Portland. My contact with Oregon resumed after immigrating to Southern California in 2001. While participating in Edge Prize I met Cascadia people online and learned about many amazing activities and projects. As a southern outpost of Salmon Nation, I feel an affinity with my northern neighbours. I engage in bioregional work through online networking as well as on-ground and wish to support Regenerate Cascadia however I might be of practical service.",

That curiosity is why after graduating from business school I became a small scale farmer, rancher, and budding Permaculture practitioner.\r\n\r\nAfter a deep focus on understanding and stewarding landscapes, I came to realize that humans know how to cultivate abundant and resilient ecosystems. Despite our desperate need for that to happen, our ever expanding human built environment and our runaway cultural compulsion towards separation from nature and each other gets in our way.\r\n\r\nI am now exploring the ecology of social and cultural systems and how we can discover ways that Homo sapiens can adapt towards better relationships with Earth. Now I ask: How can we as a species rediscover our landscapes as home?\r\n\r\nCurrently I am part of a community called Earth Regenerators that is cultivating a learning and support ecosystem to explore questions like that. I founded a group within that community called Bioregional Catalysts that is searching for real world examples of communities coming together for landscape scale regeneration to distribute and facilitate replication of what we learn across the planet. We also support individuals and small groups who aspire to convene their communities to see their landscapes as a whole in order to enable local regeneration.\r\n\r\nI am a facilitator, a cultural scaffold builder, a content creator, an aspiring storyteller, and I am in service to the planetary scale community commons.",

The good news is that it really is possible to regenerate the Earth at the scales needed. In order to do so, we must consciously and intentionally evolve humanity into a\u00a0<em>planetary species</em>\u00a0and learn to cooperate at unprecedented levels. We must organize ourselves around holistic, integrated landscapes known as bioregions, and connect those bioregions into a planetary network of learning exchanges.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Design School are working together on the ground in bioregions while simultaneously building a planetary network and community engaging in this kind of bioregional work. We are learning how to cooperate at the levels needed by practicing and working within Prosocial groups.
